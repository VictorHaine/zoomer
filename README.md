# Zoomer

A VS-Code extension which allows for finely tuned zoom levels.

## Motivation

I built this since I was frustrated with not being able to get the perfect text size; too big, too small, ugh. So I built this.

## Demo

## Usage

### Shortcuts

Mac `Command` `+` or `-`
Windows `Control+` `+` or `-`
Linux `Command+` `+` or `-`

### Settings

Head to Zoomer settings in Code and set your custom zoom factor!

## Publishing

1. `npm install -g vsce`
2. `vsce publish minor`
3. `vsce package`
4. `vsce publish`
